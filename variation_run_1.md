# variation_run_1

- This is to run variations with IP on/off (with `ip-a` and `ip-b` turned on and off separately).
- Additionally, turning on/off with normalization (L2) of inputs. 
- There are 2 different manual runs in the file. 
    - `IPsamespeedasSP`: `max_eta_ip = eta_sp_ltp = 1e-3` 
    - `IPfasterthanSP`: `max_eta_ip = 1e-2 > eta_sp_ltp = 1e-3`
